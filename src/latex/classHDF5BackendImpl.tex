Implements the H\-D\-F5 backend. Creates one big table in the file, and writes one row per dump. N\-O\-T\-E\-: Because dump may be called from multiple processes, we close and open the H\-D\-F5 file every dump. This is inefficient, but dumps are not that common anyhow, and we get the ability to read hdf5 files mid-\/simulation. (alternatively, we could have an extra thread exclusively dedicated to writing stats). 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
